# Image Caption Generator
We used **Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (BLIP)** pretrained  base model to build an **API** using Python **Flask**.
a simple front end made using HTML, CSS, vanilla JS. the front end interacts with the API to pass images and retrieve captions.

## Usage
**Note:** Unfortunetly, this is a static website. Further development will be done in the near future.
In the Model directory you can find the **model_api.py** run that first.
