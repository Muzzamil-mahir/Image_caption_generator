# Image Caption Generator
We used **Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (BLIP)** pretrained  base model to build an **API** using Python **Flask**.
a simple front end made using HTML, CSS, vanilla JS. the front end interacts with the API to pass images and retrieve captions.

## Usage
**Note:** Unfortunetly, this is a static website. Further development will be done in the near future.<br>

In the Model directory you can find the **model_api.py** run that first.<br>
First create a Virtual Environment.use Python's venv.<br>
Then get all the requirments by executing the below command.<br>

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

Then run **model_api.py**.<br>
Once the api server is up and running you can launch the frontend.
